# README #

This repository provides an R package template supporting the use of the Rcpp
and/or RcppArmadillo packages.

## Git, SSH keys, and RStudio 

The git repository is accessible using the ssh (__S__ecure __Sh__ell) protocol.
Connecting to a remote git repository requires a git client to be installed. To
establish if RStudio has recognized your git installation select the choice
`Global Options...` from the `Tools` menu, then click on `Git/SVN` in the left
panel.

If your Git executable is shown as `(Not Found)` you probably need to install a
git client; for instructions click
[here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) (or just google it).
